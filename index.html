The most vulnerable flood affected families with fully damaged houses who lost their entire houses need lifesaving shelter assistance for a new shelter. Most of the floods affected people are still displaced and living in temporary shelters.</p>

            <h1>They're very Helpless</h1>
            <p>After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was hit again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone underwater again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases. The Bangladesh Government continues to mobilize resources to support the affected communities, such as basic food, water purification tablets, and cash grants. However, further support from charitable organizations and development partners is still desperately needed.</p>
